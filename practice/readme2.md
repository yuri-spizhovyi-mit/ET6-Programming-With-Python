## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository documents our journey through the **Collaborative Data Science Project (CDSP)**. From identifying the core problem to delivering our final presentation, we used data science to investigate:

## 🧩 Research Breakdown

To dig deeper, we split the main question into focused sub-questions:

| Sub-question| Description|Lead|
|---|---|---|
|**Barriers and Demographics**| Social and systemic barriers for displaced youth| Khadija al Ramlawi|
|**Entry-Level IT Opportunities**| Types and requirements of available jobs| Shaima Mohamed|
|**Education Models and Accessibility**| Traditional vs. alternative education pathways| Yuri Spizhovyi|
|**Employment Outcomes**| How different education paths impact job access| Yevheniia Rudenko|
|**Employer Perceptions**| Employer preferences and hiring criteria| Olubusayo Solola & Nelson Fodjo|

## 🌟 Key Finding

> **Non-traditional education pathways (bootcamps, online courses, nonprofit programs) offer displaced youth a scalable and accessible entry into IT careers—particularly roles like IT support, QA, and junior web development.**

---

## ✅ Conclusion

While college degrees offer higher salaries, they are often out of reach.  
Our research shows that displaced youth can successfully launch tech careers through:

- 🖥️ **Entry-level roles** with low barriers  
- 🎓 **Alternative education** formats  
- 🤝 **Mentorship and job placement support**  
- 📍 **Programs targeting key states** (CA, TX, FL, NY)  
- 💼 **Cross-sector inclusion initiatives**
