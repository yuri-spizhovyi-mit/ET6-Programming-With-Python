https://betterdwelling.com/canadian-real-estate-prices-slip-sharply-further-downward-pressure-builds/,"Canadian Real Estate Prices Slip Sharply, Further Downward Pressure Builds - Better Dwelling","Weak demand for Canadian real estate continues to push prices lower. Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data shows the price of a composite benchmark (typical) home made a sharp downtick in April. The medium-term trend also reveals this is a more complicated issue than just trade war jitters. Over the past few years, buyers have been rejecting price increases at lower and lower levels, indicating more downward pressures are forming.

Canadian real estate prices slipped further last month. The price of a benchmark (typical) home fell 0.7% (-$4,800) to $701,900 in April. This  represents a 3.6% (-$26,100) decline from last year, and it’s clear in the chart above that prices have traded a fairly narrow range in recent months. The price of a typical home in Canada was roughly the same price back in 2021.

Growth has been decelerating according to the CREA HPI. The 3.6% contraction last month marked the fourth month of consecutive deceleration for the annual growth rate. This was the sharpest annual change since September 2024, rolling back minor progress made at the end of last year. 
Canadian real estate heading lower may come as a surprise considering how much prices have dropped since peaking in 2022. A typical home is 17.6% (-$149,700) lower than the March 2022 record high. CREA’s HPI has now peaked 3 times since the initial correction from the all-time high, establishing lower highs (peaks) each time. This is called a triple top in asset prices, and shows that buyers rejected price increases faster each time. 
Canadian real estate prices slipped further last month, and buyers are more hesitant about price increases despite cheaper financing and more leverage. It’s easy to dismiss this as another casualty of the trade war, but that doesn’t explain a 3-year long trend. There’s very real concerns around affordability and value, the latter being a very under-discussed issue. Many of the country’s most expensive cities have seen considerable corrections, like Toronto. However, it’s not clear if the price drop is enough to make it a deal—these cities used to have low unemployment, and presented unique opportunities. Now they barely resemble their pre-2020 reputations, and struggle to compete with more affordable regions poaching top talent. 
Or, you know... wait for your bank's economist to repeat the insights next week. Whateves.

Compare to ridiculous inflation on food prices, taxes, insurance premiums, energy cost increases, home goods and all supplies , housing prices are very undervalued@ it is time to buy since it won’t stay like this for a long time. It is a false pricing situation only!
First time I’ve seen anyone make that excellent point at the end, and captured exactly how I feel. 
People would have scrambled for a $600k Toronto condo back in 2019, but now few people even care. No one is willing to discuss the vacancy rate and the fact that no one wants to rent any of these places without parking, but that doesn’t mean the problem isn’t very real and getting worse by the day. 
Every credit bubble claims its biggest cities, since the youngest workers can’t establish themselves & don’t see a future. This may be Toronto’s 90s Montreal moment, and Calgary may be having its 90s Toronto moment.
Millennials are the dumbest generation we have ever worked with. They left their common sense at the cash register and overpay for everything. Now that prices are reversing. Thousands are going underwater on their mortgages and loans everyday. Here is tip Sherlock, wait buy CHEAP
Feels like some kind of further breakdown in market segments would be useful.
Looking at “starter homes” around Leslieville in Toronto, the last few weeks saw everything on offer get bought up for prices that seem (anecdotally, i guess) a good 15-20% above what they were going for last year.  It’s true for the same price you can buy 3 or 4 comparable sized, comparatively brand new semis/town houses in Edmonton… but it seems a lot of people with $1-1.4 million to spend in Toronto are not finding the value Edmonton is offering in that math.  Maybe they’re just the greatest fools?
But if it was just that, condos still seem frozen and falling.
In the higher end segment, it feels like the only things really struggling are certain houses newly built in the last 5-10 years, whose current owners all think they’re automatically worth well over $3 million, regardless of location or…any other factor… most likely because these owners overpaid at some point since 2016.
Just to say it seems there’s some kind of greater nuance to be sussed out in whatever’s going on here.
Condo prices need to drop 50% so I can buy two shoeboxes, knockout a wall and have a small downtown apartment…
Take out your MPAC statement and compare the assessed value with the prices of the last two or three sales in your neighborhood. Besides all the work necessary to change the mill rate, why do the “professionals” offer such a disconnect in value? LOL
Risk is starting to assert itself in the credit market. Fewer dumb dollars trying to hop into the palms of the newly arrived & destitute future Canucks. Let’s see how far RE falls.
There’s no permitts for new condo buildings
You will see a shortage again in 3 years especially if Canada allows another 500 000.indians per year here and %90 come to GTA

https://betterdwelling.com/canadian-real-estate-prices-hit-multi-month-high-demand-weakest-since-2009/,"Canadian Real Estate Prices Hit Multi-Month High, Demand Weakest Since 2009 - Better Dwelling","Canadian real estate demand is nearing historic weakness but it doesn’t appear buyers have noticed. Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data shows home prices inched higher in March, hitting a multi-month high. At the same time the market has seen sales fall to the lowest level in over a decade, while inventory climbed and pushed the demand balance to the weakest level since the Great Recession.

Canadian existing home prices hit a new multi-month high. The unadjusted price of a typical home hit $712,200 in March, rising just 0.04% (+$300) in the month. That minor climb was just enough to bring prices to a 7-month high, back to September 2024-levels.

Source: CREA; Better Dwelling. 
The struggle for price growth is real. Prices were down 2.1% (-$15,300) compared to last year, with annual growth now the weakest since September 2024. It’s also now clear that annual growth’s second attempt at moving into positive territory has failed, indicating that buyers see prices as too rich for their blood. 
Those recalling that February was higher aren’t imagining it. The composite for February 2025 had been reported initially at $713,700, but it appears the modeling set has been revised. CREA conducts annual revisions of the HPI that impact historical data, but they typically are done with the May release. This was two months early. 
The seemingly random application of the self-imposed rules by the industry isn’t without controversy. Previously, the methodology update shrunk the national price peak and thus correction, statistically eliminating the bubble. At least one prominent economist no longer uses the index, labeling it as “unreliable.”
Caveat emptor. 
Canadian real estate demand is the weakest its been in well over a decade. Unadjusted home sales climbed 9.3% from last year to 39,202 units in March. Last month saw the weakest sales since 2009, right in the thick of the Global Financial Crisis. It’s also worth recalling that the population was much smaller back then—about 1 in 7 people in Canada weren’t present in 2009. 
At the same time inventory has been on the rise. Unadjusted new listings climbed 13.1% to 86,953 homes in March. This helped to push the sales to new listings ratio (SNLR) to 45.1%, down 11.1 points from last year. That places the market on the lower end of balanced territory, which is unusually weak for a national measure. It was the lowest SNLR since 2009, with the mid-90s being the only other time it fell to this level. 
Or, you know... wait for your bank's economist to repeat the insights next week. Whateves.

Sounds like you are financially you are in over your head and need lower rates to survive , correct me if i am wrong
Sure let’s keep prices high in Peterborough aka druggies central…

https://betterdwelling.com/toronto-real-estate-prices-rise-despite-sales-collapsing-25-lower/,Toronto Real Estate Prices Rise Despite Sales Collapsing 25% Lower - Better Dwelling,"Greater Toronto real estate demand further eroded last month, but buyers likely didn’t notice. Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) data shows home prices climbed in February. It wasn’t due to a lack of inventory, which hit the highest level since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Nor was it due to sales, which fell to one of the lowest levels on record. It appears this trend is driven entirely by exuberance.

Greater Toronto real estate prices advanced last month, though not as much as it did the year before. The price of a typical home increased 0.4% in February to end the month at $1,073,900, about 1.8% lower than the same time last year. This time last year, prices made a move about 7x larger. 
That said, the annual trend looks to be heading in the opposite direction of a recovery.

Despite buyers paying more, sales are collapsing while inventory piles up. TRREB reported just 4,037 sales in February, down 27.5% from last year. Outside of the pandemic year, this was the weakest month since the Global Financial Crisis.   
The falling sales weren’t due to a lack of inventory either. Annual growth of new listings came in 5.4% higher to hit 12,066 homes in February. This helped to push total active inventory to the highest level since, well… the Global Financial Crisis.  
Fewer buyers and more sellers helped to push the sales to new listings ratio (SNLR) higher. The fundamental demand measure fell to 34% in February, placing it firmly below the balanced market threshold. Experts generally believe that an SNLR below 40% indicates a market is oversupplied relative to demand, and prices will fall. It appears buyers disagree. 
Greater Toronto real estate saw some of the weakest demand on record, and loftiest inventory levels in decades. However, prices advanced slightly from a month prior. It might seem perplexing from a strictly supply and demand perspective, but this is credit-driven exuberance. It wasn’t unexpected either, with the Bank of Canada (BoC) recently warning policy makers against “mortgage tinkering,” as it would cause exactly this type of scenario. Mission accomplished.
Or, you know... wait for your bank's economist to repeat the insights next week. Whateves.

What’s Toronto’s plan once all of the normal people flee and its just 8 people overbidding each other for the same houses?
Price movements on low volumes don’t reflect asset value. It represents exuberance, and price will be determined when the volume returns (either at lower or higher prices). This is finance 101. The people paying more right now likely have no clue what they’re in for in the coming months.
Anybody that bought a Toronto home the last 10 years are suckers or rich.
yeah sure, RE in Canada has nothing to do with finance 101…i keep reading valuable insights however none apply here. Care to check this site’s comments for 10 years vs what the reality is with housing pricing nowadays?
Or it could be due to dodgy statistics.
 ” is a non-profit professional association of registered real estate brokers and salespeople” and  “TRREB currently has over 73,000 Realtor members,[3] the most of any real estate association in Canada. ” (Wikipedia)
If I were buying a home today, I wouldn’t be inspired to overbid because of their stats.
Bank of Canada will drop rates to zero to save house prices.
Canada must focus on what they are good at and that is house prices. Support house prices at all costs!!
My mother’s house had 3 offers on the 4th day of listing this March and sold for over asking price. It sold for more than similar houses in the same neighbourhood sold for within the past months of 2025 and all of 2024. If a good house has a good RE agent and it is priced right it will attract buyers and it will sell sooner than later.

https://betterdwelling.com/canadian-real-estate-markets-see-supply-soar-as-investors-exit-rbc/,Canadian Real Estate Markets See Supply Soar As Investors Exit: RBC  - Better Dwelling,"Canadian real estate markets aren’t firming up with rate cuts—demand is softening. RBC is warning investors that early data shows rate cuts failed to stimulate major markets in July. In fact, they generally observed the opposite trend—sales continued to weaken while inventory climbed, as investors try to lighten their market exposure in key regions like Toronto.
The Bank of Canada (BoC) rate cuts marked a turning point for real estate, according to RBC. Not because of what the markets did, but because of what they didn’t—neither the June or July rate cuts were able to stimulate buyers psychologically. 
“After a small uptick between May and June, home resales fell again in some markets including Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto in July, according to early reports from local real estate boards,” explains Robert Hogue, Assistant Chief Economist at RBC. 
The bank doesn’t see recent cuts stimulating much demand. They believe much deeper cuts will need to be seen before mortgages are cheap enough to stimulate markets. 
Only a handful of major markets have reported July data, but the ones that have, show a slow market. That appears to be amplified by price distribution, with more expensive markets seeing slow sales and much higher inventory levels.  
The supply and demand balance remains tight in Calgary, Edmonton, and Montreal—where sellers retain the power, potentially meaning higher prices in the future. Vancouver and Fraser Valley find themselves in balanced markets, with supply and demand balanced at the current price level—though slipping towards buyers. Toronto was the only region to plunge into oversupplied territory, implying lower prices may be needed to get inventory flowing.

Virtually all markets in the group have seen conditions ease from last year. Annual growth of new listings outpaced that of sales in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, and Fraser Valley. Edmonton was an outlier with sales significantly outpacing new inventory. Last but not least was Montreal, where sales just outpaced listings. 
Source: RBC. 
The reason for the sudden surge of inventory varies, according to RBC. However, markets are currently being driven by two factors—investors pulling some off the table and sellers that thought rate cuts would end the downturn. 
“In some cases, such as in Toronto, it reflects the completion of many newly built units (mainly condos) that owners (mainly investors) are looking to offload. In other cases, it could be sellers betting lower rates will spur buyer interest and improve sale outcomes. In some, it may signify homeowner distress arising from high rates,” Hogue explains. 
In any case, the bank continues to see the market sputtering over the next few months. They repeated that much larger rate cuts will need to be observed for any material impact on demand. 
Or, you know... wait for your bank's economist to repeat the insights next week. Whateves.

How many years of purchasing did they pull forward? Because that’s the answer on how long this takes to fix.
Realistically, what’s the plan in Canada. Every generation is just going to sell a home for the cost of a home plus their retirement? Like a perpetually long debt ponzi?
Nah, of course that’s not the plan. The pensions purchased a reverse mortgage lender, so it stops with the current generation when they borrow high interest loans to find a small portion of retirement, that will compound and eat up their total equity.

If lower interest rates are coming, why buy now.
Wait for the lower interest rates and get a lower interest rate mortgage.
Answer: Asset inflation. Low interest rates don’t make the purchase cheaper. They just make the financing less painful. In the end, homes become more expensive because in the long run, most homeowners don’t factor in a key factor called “functional/energy obsolesence” which means unless you can sell your home for profit before you have invested in any other upgrades other than cosmetic, you also have another carry cost of living in the said home. So unless the asset inflation outpaces the cost to maintain the home (which is unlikely under the current conditions) not many home that are 20 years or older would qualify as “investments”. This wasn’t as much a factor in the last 10-15 year run, but it is now. Unless you think that a 1200 sq. foot bungalow worth $1M will be 1.5M in five years from now in any given market. Good luck with that.
Investors are spooked, only sharks and hungry bears left looking for deals.  Last one out holds the heaviest bag.  Unless they bought 10+ years ago, everyone will be luck to take a 100k haircut at those crazy precon prices.
Interest rates do little in a falling market. I noted a fall of 5% was stated for GTA last month.  Maybe the real crash is about to happen. Prices might just fall off a cliff.  Where is the bottom, could be 3 times earnings, as was normal in the past. might even go below 3 times earnings for a while. Demand will eventually push prices back up but that might take a while and prices might never return to current 10 times earning levels.
 All the comments I see expect a 10 % to 20 % fall over the next year could be right, but then again its possible that property could be down to 25% of current prices in the near future. The key is always the rate of fall, at 5% a year fall you will still get buyers, at a 20% fall per year there are very few buyers. We are drifting into that 20 % area and that is when the bottom will fall out of the market.
Not sure who thought that the 1/2 point total reduction so far would stimulate anything. We have an exodus of investors who simply can no longer afford 5% plus rates while owning rental properties. The choice is simple, sell, even if it’s at a loss. Just had a client do this exact thing, they were happier to take a 40k loss than continue to pay 4600+ a month mortgage. When they purchased in 2019, that same mortgage was $1800. We have no mom and pop investors anymore as rents simple will not cover costs, not even close to it. Those same investors have seen drops in the equity of their principal homes as well, so double whammy, 15-30% loss in value and a 200%+ cost increase in carrying a HELOC, which most utilized to invest, simple math folks.
Probably anyone that can do math since that’s 15% more leverage. Now I’m not sure why so many people fail to realize that every bubble has popped with falling rates at the same time too.
Salty tones! 
  Start with the possibility of a home equity tax. That in itself  before the fall session would cause many to jump ship as we are seeing now. Yes  prices are too high driven by investors bidding against legitimate families looking to buy a home not to mention known money laundering.. The “Investors” have caused this conundrum and can claim their losses . They are playing with their own money, have driven prices out of reach for many in that wages are nowhere near commensurate with current market conditions. That explains the affordability issue. “Investors” have caused, and  are the problem.  Canadians are broke and Canada is in at minimum a recession no matter how they fudge the numbers.
What is 15% more leverage going to do when they are already in the hole 20-30% on equity, and thier rates have gone up 200-300%? The issue is affordability, That 1/2 point drop does nothing for affordability or ability to qualify at over a 7% rate on a stress test.
In this market, there are very few investors as many relied on HELOC’s to invest, that cost is now way to high, plus equity drop in thier principal residences make it more difficult from an affordability standpoint. They are not bidding against legitimate families, they are not bidding at all. Cash buyers are king right now, unfortunately there are not very many of them. As for investors “causing ” this, if it were not for them investing in the housing market, there would a bigger housing issue, and a rental market that would be even worse than what we have as no one else is investing to provide rental market units. The blame falls flat on the shoulders of the Feds, failure to deal with a housing crisis, an immigration policy that is out of control and putting a restriction on purchasing by those immigrants they are allowing in by the 100’s of thousands.
In the late 89′, early 90…as a mortgage underwriter..I witnessed condos fall 50% in a year and single family dwellings by almost as much. Rates were around 10% back then but people bought on the false hope of quick appreciation. The only thing keeping the market alive right now is the banks willingness to reverse amortize renewals otherwise the glut would invite panic. Good luck to the greedy fools!
That’s exactly what’s keeping this bogus market afloat!
No brainer – investors have ditched Canada to buy new houses in the USA for less than 400K.
So between 2015 and 2024, housing prices on average in Canada more than doubled. IN 9 years that’s a 8+% RISE compounded annually. During that time nominal gdp per capita was 44.1k in 2023 vs 43.6K in 2015 Thats a net change of 1,1% over the same period?
So what happened was the govt, developers, banks and realtors used artificially high growth in the housing market to pretend they had GDP growth? The worst part, with Real estate now being the biggest single sector in our economy, up PAST 40% OF OUR GDP. In 2014 that was 17% of our GDP?
To put this in perspective in 2014, the single biggest sector in our economy was Resource extraction (mining, O&G) at 30% of our 2014 GDP. By 2024 that number has dropped to 5%?
Now peo0p-le will say, but you know our GDP went up didnt it? Well no it really didnt. If you take housing at 17%, of 2014 GDP thats $310B, and Resources were $555B. Today with a GDP of 2.08B (vs 1.85B in 2015), housing is now $827B, more than doubled, and Resources are down to 105B (or down 80%!!!)?
The problem is housing is an inflationary asset. Artificially increasing housing prices without consummate GDP gains is just a way to debase the currency. This is why we feel poor, there are roughly 2.4 2024 dollars for every 2015 dollar. The other problem is that resources generate a positive balance of trade, housing does not. So in effect our exports, and therefore, forex, dropped by $445B  since 2015?
So if we look to exports, in 2000 our GDP was 45% exports. Today its about 30%? So clearly all this monkey business with green transition has severely damaged our economy, and Trudeaus trickle down housing inflaiton program has not helped anyone other than a few at the very top?

https://betterdwelling.com/canadian-real-estate-has-young-adults-immigrants-considering-a-move/,Canadian Real Estate Has Young Adults & Immigrants Considering A Move  - Better Dwelling,"Canadian policymakers created a bigger issue than the one they tried to solve with population growth. A new survey from Angus Reid found that 1 in 4 households are seriously considering leaving their province due to housing costs. Two key demographics are feeling the lion’s share of the pressure—young adults and recent immigrants. The problem is also spreading outside of major cities and into regions like Halifax and St Johns, traditionally more affordable but now slipping out of reach. 
Canadian real estate prices are pushing households to “seriously” consider leaving their province. The cost of shelter has over 1 in 4 (28%) households looking into leaving the province they reside. The share was higher in more expensive provinces like Ontario (39%), and British Columbia (36%). 
Source: Angus Reid.
Provinces with more affordable shelter options are doing slightly better, such as Nova Scotia (25%), and Newfoundland (22%). Though that’s still roughly a quarter of each respective province feeling pressure to leave due to their housing costs. 
Being an issue of affordability, few would be surprised to hear the issue is worse in cities. The share ready to leave their province due to shelter was highest in Toronto, where over 2 in 5 (44%) of people are weighing their options. The surrounding 905 suburbs also have the same rate of people looking to flee, providing insight into why these households want to leave the province, not just move to the burbs. 
Source: Angus Reid.
The share drops sharply after Toronto,  but still represents significant potential outflows. Behind Toronto is Vancouver, where a third (33%) of Vancouver is considering a new province. Rounding out the top 3 cities that make residents want to scream is a new entrant in the pricey real estate scene—Halifax, where 1 in 4 (26%) of residents are considering a new province. 
On the flip side of that data are the more affordable markets, where people are in a less urgent rush out the door. The two cities with the smallest share of people ready to leave the city were Winnipeg (16% of people), and Regina (15%). Both cities had rates similar to their respective provinces, and while low in contrast to Toronto and Vancouver, that’s still 1 in 7 people. That’s a problem. 
Canada’s recent immigrants may be starting to question if they were oversold on opportunity. Almost 2 in 5 (39%) immigrants that arrived within the past 10 years, are considering leaving their province due to housing costs. It’s much higher than the share of immigrants that arrived 10 or more years ago (30%), and people born in Canada (27%). Once again, the latter two may seem low in contrast but that’s still over 1 in 4 people. 
Source: Angus Reid.
Canada wasn’t always an incredibly expensive place to live, especially in smaller towns. Consequently, overly stretched values impact young adults much more than older Canadians. It’s a trend that’s easily observed in the survey data. 
Over 2 in 5 young adults (42%)  aged 18 to 24 years old are currently planning their escape due home prices. Those ranging from 25 to 54 years old were fairly consistent, ranging from 32-35% considering moving. When we get those approaching retirement, there’s a big shift in recovery and timelines. 
As Canadians reach their golden years, they’re less likely to want to leave their province.  Just 1 in 4 people (25%) from 55 to 64 years old were considering a move during the survey. It falls to just 13% for those 65+. Older Canadians are the most likely to own their home and least likely looking for new career opportunities, making the relatively small share understandable. 
Canada’s soaring home prices have produced very different outcomes for different groups. On one hand, older households have seen their property values surge over the past few years. Rising prices are good for those positioned to benefit. Having stable, affordable homeownership drastically reduces the pressures of suddenly soaring real estate prices.  
However, that’s generally not the scenario young adults and recent immigrants are facing. As home prices climbed faster than wages, homeownership moved further out of reach. At the same time, policymakers chasing aggressive population growth have produced a surplus of labor, creating more job competition and applying downward pressure on wages. Not surprisingly, the unemployment rate is significantly higher for these demographics growing increasingly frustrated with shelter costs.
Or, you know... wait for your bank's economist to repeat the insights next week. Whateves.

Going to be hilarious when the stragglers realize that Freeland’s capital gains tax changes mean she gets a bigger cut on the export tax anyone that leaves has to pay. 
Also a little surprised by hearing the CRA is accusing people who left Canada before the closing date of their property, are being accused of holding an investment property, and trying to negotiate taxes on what should have been tax free. When they get down to greasy negotiations like this, things are going to get a lot worse, really fast.
Interesting, so if a person sells a principle residence, do they have to pay capital gains tax, if one just takes the cashes and uses it to purchase sometime else like gold or art?
I moved to Halifax about 10 years ago. It was $300k for my house. Neighbourhood is going for $1.2 million. I absolutely would not have moved here if the price was getting close to Toronto.  
Seriously, people are nice and there’s lots of government employment (for now), but I don’t understand what people are paying for. These places aren’t selling fast either, but they take almost a year to move… still “hot” according to Realtors on the news. FML
Pierre’s going to tear through government employment. More than half the employment created in the past 4 years has been government, not private industry. It should be a frickin’ crime what they’re doing.
Pierre is promising to give PR to all the students currently set to get the boot. 
He’s not the messiah, he’s just a dumber, meaner Trudeau.
Toronto has no soul. They not like us in the rest of Canada.  
Seriously, big city but it’s like the Disneyland of cities—you can watch a baseball game, a Raptors game, the Leafs, or a Taylor Swift concert. Otherwise the rest of the city is just in sad state of restaurants perpetually turning over, because the commercial rents are so high no one can actually make a dime.
I love how neither Victoria nor even the rest of the Island never makes these lists.  We are a country unto ourselves.
A mass influx anywhere will result in rising housing prices. Most people need to live near employment.  If Halifax and St. John’s are “slipping out of reach” where  will people go?
An international analysis where they reviewed why housing affordability significantly declined in many countries since the early 2000s, they concluded the primary cause is too much red tape. Cities limiting construction in suburbs that they weren’t doing in the 1980s kind of thing. They used Toronto as an example, housing affordability remained constant for 30 years then started getting worse when they blocked expansion.
The problem isn’t people wanting to leave, it’s where are they going to go. The cheap markets are cheap for a reason.
Interest rates should go to 10 per cent and get rid of all this excess debt . Let the banks take the hit.
Friends hire friends and relatives in the federal public sector. That’s where the majority of jobs are going towards helping the cliques.

Provinces with more affordable shelter options are doing slightly better, such as Nova Scotia (25%), and Newfoundland (22%). Though that’s still roughly a quarter of each respective province feeling pressure to leave due to their housing costs. Being an issue of affordability, few would be surprised to hear the issue is worse in cities. The share ready to leave their province due to shelter was highest in Toronto, where over 2 in 5 (44%) of people are weighing their options. The surrounding 905 suburbs also have the same rate of people looking to flee, providing insight into why these households want to leave the province, not just move to the burbs. Source: Angus Reid.
The share drops sharply after Toronto, but still represents significant potential outflows. Behind Toronto is Vancouver, where a third (33%) of Vancouver is considering a new province. Rounding out the top 3 cities that make residents want to scream is a new entrant in the pricey real estate scene—Halifax, where 1 in 4 (26%) of residents are considering a new province. On the flip side of that data are the more affordable markets, where people are in a less urgent rush out the door. The two cities with the smallest share of people ready to leave the city were Winnipeg (16% of people), and Regina (15%). Both cities had rates similar to their respective provinces, and while low in contrast to Toronto and Vancouver, that’s still 1 in 7 people. That’s a problem. Canada’s recent immigrants may be starting to question if they were oversold on opportunity. Almost 2 in 5 (39%) immigrants that arrived within the past 10 years, are considering leaving their province due to housing costs. It’s much higher than the share of immigrants that arrived 10 or more years ago (30%), and people born in Canada (27%). Once again, the latter two may seem low in contrast but that’s still over 1 in 4 people. Source: Angus Reid.
Canada wasn’t always an incredibly expensive place to live, especially in smaller towns. Consequently, overly stretched values impact young adults much more than older Canadians. It’s a trend that’s easily observed in the survey data. Over 2 in 5 young adults (42%) aged 18 to 24 years old are currently planning their escape due home prices. Those ranging from 25 to 54 years old were fairly consistent, ranging from 32-35% considering moving. When we get those approaching retirement, there’s a big shift in recovery and timelines. As Canadians reach their golden years, they’re less likely to want to leave their province. Just 1 in 4 people (25%) from 55 to 64 years old were considering a move during the survey. It falls to just 13% for those 65+. Older Canadians are the most likely to own their home and least likely looking for new career opportunities, making the relatively small share understandable. Canada’s soaring home prices have produced very different outcomes for different groups. On one hand, older households have seen their property values surge over the past few years. Rising prices are good for those positioned to benefit. Having stable, affordable homeownership drastically reduces the pressures of suddenly soaring real estate prices. However, that’s generally not the scenario young adults and recent immigrants are facing. As home prices climbed faster than wages, homeownership moved further out of reach. At the same time, policymakers chasing aggressive population growth have produced a surplus of labor, creating more job competition and applying downward pressure on wages. Not surprisingly, the unemployment rate is significantly higher for these demographics growing increasingly frustrated with shelter costs.

Going to be hilarious when the stragglers realize that Freeland’s capital gains tax changes mean she gets a bigger cut on the export tax anyone that leaves has to pay. Also a little surprised by hearing the CRA is accusing people who left Canada before the closing date of their property, are being accused of holding an investment property, and trying to negotiate taxes on what should have been tax free. When they get down to greasy negotiations like this, things are going to get a lot worse, really fast.
Interesting, so if a person sells a principle residence, do they have to pay capital gains tax, if one just takes the cashes and uses it to purchase sometime else like gold or art?
I moved to Halifax about 10 years ago. It was $300k for my house. Neighbourhood is going for $1.2 million. I absolutely would not have moved here if the price was getting close to Toronto. Seriously, people are nice and there’s lots of government employment (for now), but I don’t understand what people are paying for. These places aren’t selling fast either, but they take almost a year to move… still “hot” according to Realtors on the news. FML
Pierre’s going to tear through government employment. More than half the employment created in the past 4 years has been government, not private industry. It should be a frickin’ crime what they’re doing.
Pierre is promising to give PR to all the students currently set to get the boot. He’s not the messiah, he’s just a dumber, meaner Trudeau.
Toronto has no soul. They not like us in the rest of Canada. Seriously, big city but it’s like the Disneyland of cities—you can watch a baseball game, a Raptors game, the Leafs, or a Taylor Swift concert. Otherwise the rest of the city is just in sad state of restaurants perpetually turning over, because the commercial rents are so high no one can actually make a dime.
I love how neither Victoria nor even the rest of the Island never makes these lists. We are a country unto ourselves.
A mass influx anywhere will result in rising housing prices. Most people need to live near employment. If Halifax and St. John’s are “slipping out of reach” where will people go?
An international analysis where they reviewed why housing affordability significantly declined in many countries since the early 2000s, they concluded the primary cause is too much red tape. Cities limiting construction in suburbs that they weren’t doing in the 1980s kind of thing. They used Toronto as an example, housing affordability remained constant for 30 years then started getting worse when they blocked expansion.
The problem isn’t people wanting to leave, it’s where are they going to go. The cheap markets are cheap for a reason.
Interest rates should go to 10 per cent and get rid of all this excess debt . Let the banks take the hit.
Friends hire friends and relatives in the federal public sector. That’s where the majority of jobs are going towards helping the cliques.

Canadian Household Debt Grew 2x Faster Than 2019, Driven By Mortgages
Canadian households may have trade jitters, but that isn’t stopping them from borrowing. Household debt climbed 0.2% (+$6.2 billion) to reach $3.04 trillion in February—double 2019’s growth rate. Mortgage credit drove 84% of the month’s increase, indicating refinancing and new housing are making up for the lack of existing home sales. While slower than the zero-rate frenzy, credit expansion is moving with pre-pandemic norms.

Canadian Job Market Diverges From US, Weak Loonie Usually Follows: BMO
Canada’s labor market is diverging from the US at a 25-year extreme, with unemployment now 1.7 points higher. BMO warns such gaps historically precede loonie depreciation, as the Bank of Canada (BoC) addresses slower consumption and falling inflation. This risk is amplified by Canada’s unaddressed productivity, which ironically would worsen as non-productive credit growth is incentivized.

The Bank of Canada’s feared “mortgage renewal cliff” proved more like a curb: payments rose just 10%—33% less than forecast.

https://betterdwelling.com/toronto-real-estate-prices-fall-below-1m-sales-at-90s-crash-levels/,"Toronto Real Estate Prices Fall Below $1M, Sales At 90s Crash Levels - Better Dwelling","The Greater Toronto real estate market is still in freefall as the anticipated boom proves to be an epic bust. Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) data shows the price of a typical home (composite benchmark) continued to fall in April. A typical house in the City is now under the $1 million mark, as the multi-year downturn led to the highest April inventory in over 15 years, and sales fell to 90s-real estate crash levels. 
Greater Toronto home prices are still falling. TRREB reported a composite benchmark price of $1.01 million in April, falling 5.4% (-$58.1k) from last year. In the City of Toronto, it fell to $985.4k, down 4.5% (-$46.2k) over the same period. Buyers haven’t seen the composite this close to the million dollar mark in years. The City’s benchmark falling under the $1 million threshold is a grim milestone for a market some experts thought was invincible.

Source: CREA; TRREB; Better Dwelling.
Driving the price declines was the collapse of sales. Annual growth was down 23.3% with just 5,601 home sales recorded in April. It was the weakest buying demand since 2020, the first full month of pandemic lockdowns, when buyers faced physical barriers to purchasing a home. Outside of 2020, one has to go all the way back to 1997—the depths of the last major real estate bubble collapse.
At the same time, inventory has been applying significant downward pressure on prices. Sellers listed 18,836 homes for sale last month, up 8.1% from last year. Fewer buyers and more sellers drove the sales to new listings ratio (SNLR) down to 29.7%, placing the market firmly in a buyer (or bear) market. With new listings more than triple the volume of sales, experts generally see falling prices with such a weak demand balance.   
Greater Toronto real estate active listings for April.
Source: CREA; TRREB; Better Dwelling.
Over the past few years, fewer sales and higher listings have led to inventory buildup. Total active listings climbed to 27.4k homes for sale at the end of April, up 54.0% from last year. It was the highest inventory for the month for at least 15 years, when the data series began. However, the odds favor seeing the record go back much further. The population has grown 65% since sales were this weak (pandemic excluded), and a near-record low persists.
Toronto’s collapse in real estate demand is mainly attributed to tariffs. Tariffs certainly contribute, but ignoring that market demand has been weak for years is naive. Canada’s largest bank previously warned that investors have replaced first-time buyers, after pricing them out of the market. Investors have disappeared with the easy money, but prices have yet to fall enough to incentivize buyers to jump back into the market.
Affordability is now just one of Toronto’s hurdles before reviving its market. The city’s unemployment rate is now 8%, and the exodus of young workers to Alberta continues. That makes Toronto a very different value proposition compared to the market they were priced out of a few years prior. Never count out a quick recovery, but expecting one may be wishful thinking.  
Or, you know... wait for your bank's economist to repeat the insights next week. Whateves.

We encourage you to have a civil discussion. Note that reads ""civil,"" which means don't act like jerks to each other. Still unclear? No name-calling, racism, or hate speech. Seriously, you're adults – act like it.Any comments that violates these simple rules, will be removed promptly – along with your full comment history. Oh yeah, you'll also lose further commenting privileges. So if your comments disappear, it's not because the illuminati is screening you because they hate the truth, it's because you violated our simple rules.
Bank of Canada MUST emergency drop interest rates to 0% to support house prices.
Also immigration should be increased to at least 5 million a year.
Canadians have worked hard to purchase homes and the prices must be supported by government.
Haha desperate much? Housing prices will rise forever right? So many of my friends working in Toronto have been laid off. No appetite to buy houses, even if interest rates drop. You’re going to learn a hard lesson in economics. The government can’t save you.
So, just as in the wizard of Oz (which is based on the 1880-1918 Gold / Silver debate in the USA for monetary policy), we now are living in a world of myth and fantasy.
Dropping rates is seen as some sort of panacea for all that ails Canada’s economy. The problems with this are:
1. Canada has failed to manage inflation in 3 ways. First is failing to measure CPI properly, particularly failing to measure the actual cost of interest related to an asset.
2. Canada’s rates beyond a variable rate mortgage are impacted more by Bank bond rates than the BoC overnight rate. The yield curve has been flat for a long time priomary because there is a lack of supply of investment grade bonds, not because of the BoC. If the yield curve returned to normal (and it will since its maionly BB pensions keeping it like this) we will see a 5y 200bp higher than a variable or more.
3. ON has become an economic sinkhole. The entire economy is based around 4 sectors – Housing, banking, govt, and autoparts. Currently, none of these sectors is producing any sort of value for the Canaidna economy, it is just parasitic growth, no actual value for GDP at all…
So now we will watch Carney subsdize banks, housing and govt even further, all to maintain an unrealistic price for housing, ridiculous risk free profits for banks, and subsidioes for ‘industry’ there.
Any wonder why AB, SK want to leave this country?
And all realtors, construction workers and bankers should get a tax funded GIB of $10k/ month?
Now the elections are over. Time to buy a USA house to live in every fall and winter. Millions will off load their Canadian homes and condos to kids and relatives and return to stay with them every spring and summer and enjoy life instead of snow shovels

And get deported to El Salvador for saying something the orange Cheeto doesn’t like? No thanks. Canadians aren’t that dumb (as the election results have shown).
Aren’t???
Well, election results shown exactly opposite – dumber than we could imagine.
Electing person who ASSISTED 2008-2009 crash AND created this BUBBLE – that’s very smart, yeah.
Good luck and pray to God.
You wish. But not going to happen.
Boomers are trapped in their over valued homes which they will be unable to offload to other suckers in this illiquid bear market.
They will live here and die here (sorry, not sorry). But at least they can enjoy their paper home over valuations. And their kids will always be there to shovel for them.
Look, it has cost you and me hundreds of Billions to maintain these ultra high prices. The feds have basically used every trick they have to keep prices high. So now, Carney is in a spot. He was given his job by bankers, since they like money, and the Liberals kept them form failing in covid.
So the questions is not if, but when this will collapse. The boomers are fine, its all the dummies who bought houses since 2016 that are done.
So your solution to massively overprived housing is to buy more housing? Lemme guess what kind of ‘investments’ you make?
So now lets see what our ‘new’ govt does? Im betting the same as the ‘old’ govt. Use the CHMC, BDC, EDC to prop up housing prices. Under the fraudulent claim that more ‘supply’ is the issue (though clearly it is massively overvalued prices) Carney and Freeland will throw Billions to make the GTA, Ottawa, Coastal BC even less affordable.
Ecven worse, the job market, and Canada’s competitiveness has completely collapsed. The Govt spent at least $500B in failed investments in EVs, green tech, almost all of it in ON, only to see that with the exception of the much hated piupeline the Liberals bought, not one of them has returned even a panny on those investments?
So now we are to presume in the face of a 180 from the USA on Trade, a global movement away from free trade, that Carney can ‘make good investments’?The problem is, beyond lettingPRIVATE BANKS EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE M3 MONEY SUPPLY TO BUY OVERPRICED HOUSING, Carney’s actually ‘investment’ experience is non existent.
Green investments have now consistently failed to produce any sort of return at all, and are just a cost at this point. Given that Carney seems unwilling to put aside his dismal, failed net zero model, we will end up 4-5Tr in debt and no further ahead in 4 years?
The good news is the Liberal Magic show of rebranding wont cover up this catastrophic fail.
For the ‘free market’ in housing (if one ever existed) to balance it reqquires that the GTA see prices back to where the median family income can buy an average property, so $500-600k. Only then will living in the GTA be viable for the now extinct middle class. Without immmigration, and constant handouts from Ottawa, one can only expect this to get worse.
However, the good news is in 10y, our economy will be better off, with investment going into actually produictive investment, not 500 sq foot condos to put on Airt BnB.
START PACKING THE BANKS ARE FREAKING OUT
This is so silly. It’s not in freefall, more like a correction. Housing in Toronto has been grossly overvalued. 
And all the sad people going on about boomers and their homes, should think about this. They probably paid less than 100,000 for their homes and they are now still on average worth at least a million. I think the boomers are doing just fine.

We know. Ever since they stopped letting you use ""password,"" you've felt like Sisyphus carrying that rock... but like, with passwords.","The Greater Toronto real estate market is still in freefall as the anticipated boom proves to be an epic bust. Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) data shows the price of a typical home (composite benchmark) continued to fall in April. A typical house in the City is now under the $1 million mark, as the multi-year downturn led to the highest April inventory in over 15 years, and sales fell to 90s-real estate crash levels. Greater Toronto home prices are still falling. TRREB reported a composite benchmark price of $1.01 million in April, falling 5.4% (-$58.1k) from last year. In the City of Toronto, it fell to $985.4k, down 4.5% (-$46.2k) over the same period. Buyers haven’t seen the composite this close to the million dollar mark in years. The City’s benchmark falling under the $1 million threshold is a grim milestone for a market some experts thought was invincible. Greater Toronto real estate sales through the MLS. Source: CREA; TRREB; Better Dwelling.
Driving the price declines was the collapse of sales. Annual growth was down 23.3% with just 5,601 home sales recorded in April. It was the weakest buying demand since 2020, the first full month of pandemic lockdowns, when buyers faced physical barriers to purchasing a home. Outside of 2020, one has to go all the way back to 1997—the depths of the last major real estate bubble collapse.
At the same time, inventory has been applying significant downward pressure on prices. Sellers listed 18,836 homes for sale last month, up 8.1% from last year. Fewer buyers and more sellers drove the sales to new listings ratio (SNLR) down to 29.7%, placing the market firmly in a buyer (or bear) market. With new listings more than triple the volume of sales, experts generally see falling prices with such a weak demand balance. Greater Toronto real estate active listings for April.

Over the past few years, fewer sales and higher listings have led to inventory buildup. Total active listings climbed to 27.4k homes for sale at the end of April, up 54.0% from last year. It was the highest inventory for the month for at least 15 years, when the data series began. However, the odds favor seeing the record go back much further. The population has grown 65% since sales were this weak (pandemic excluded), and a near-record low persists.
