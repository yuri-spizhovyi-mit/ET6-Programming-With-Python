"""Comparing and Asserting

Comparing two values will tell you if they are the same or not.
The `assert` statement will throw an error if it's argument is false.
    If the argument is true, it does nothing.

Together, comparing and asserting are a good way to test your understanding.
    Some of the exercises in this workshop will use assertions.
