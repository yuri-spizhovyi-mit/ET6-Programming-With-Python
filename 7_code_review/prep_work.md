# Prep Work

Take a breather, there's nothing technical in this workshop!  We'll discuss collaborative development, introduce the group deliverable, and sooth your Python anxiety.

To prepare, you can look through a couple resources from these suggested study topics.  You don't need to go in depth, it's enough to be familiar with the terms:

- [Group Norms](../suggested_study/group_norms.md)
- [Pair Programming](../suggested_study/pair_programming.md)
- [Open Source](../suggested_study/open_source.md)
