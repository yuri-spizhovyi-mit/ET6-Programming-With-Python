# Code Review

Programming is collaborative work, when you work together you help each other!
Code reviews is one of the most important ways developers can help each other
grow and deliver the best possible software.

The goal of a code review is provide _constructive feedback_. You study your
colleague's code and let them know what is good, what could be better, and
suggest improvements if you can. The most important thing to keep in mind when
writing a code review is:

- _Review the code, not the person._

If there is something you would change in the code don't say "_you_ used a bad
variable name", say something like "_this variable name_ could be more clear".
Remember that you're working towards the same goal and trying to help each other
learn.

Code review is also subjective, there is not a single correct answer. In a
collaborative project code review is a conversation not an exam. To practice
this conversation try completing these Code Review exercises with a study
partner or in a small group.

## Learning Objectives

Learn how to collaborate with a group on a single project hosted in a GitHub
repository. Practice using GitHub's project management features to organize your
group's tasks and to double-check your project's code quality.

- [ ] ü•ö **Contributor Guidelines**: Your group can define contributor
      guidelines that describes how everyone can add their work to the project.
- [ ] ü•ö **Code of Conduct**: Your group can write a code of conduct for your
      project that describes how everyone should communicate and what behavior
      is considered unproductive.
- [ ] ü•ö **Repository Contributors**: You can add group members as collaborators
      in a repository.
- [ ] ü•ö **Issue Templates**: Your group can use issue templates to make sure
      all issues are complete and relevant to the project. in your repository
      and merge changes without causing any conflicts.
- [ ] ü•ö **Continuous Integration**: You can check your code's correctness
      before pushing, and fix any mistakes that are caught by Continuous
      Integration actions.
- [ ] ü•ö **Code Review**: You can use the PR Template and CI checks to review
      another group member's code - discussing trade-offs in behavior, strategy
      and implementation to help your classmates write their best solutions
      before merging to `main`.
- üê£ **GitHub Project Management**: You can ...
  - [ ] Use issues to define tasks in a group project. Each issue should have a
        helpful title, complete description, and helpful labels.
  - [ ] Use a Project Board to organize a project's issues
  - [ ] Claim issues and track your progress with the project board
  - [ ] Link a PR to your claimed issue
  - [ ] Assign someone to review your PR
  - [ ] Use GitHub code review features to discuss your code with your reviewer
- [ ] üê£ **Fixing Merge Conflicts**: You can fix merge conflicts by selecting
      which change to keep, or deciding how to combine them. If a conflict
      occurs in a GitHub PR you can pull both branches and fix the conflict
      locally.
