# Deliverables

Working in a shared repository, you will each:

- push 2+ completed code challenges with documentation and tests
- review 2+ of your classmates’ solutions using the code review checklist

This is a chance to practice using GitHub features for code review, project management, and code quality automation.  What you learn in this exercise will prepare you for the group Data Science projects in the certificate program.  

## Checklist

- [ ] Your group used the repository we create for you
- [ ] Your group’s collaboration documents are all completed
- [ ] Your group’s project board is well-maintained
- [ ] All issues and pull requests have the correct labels (if necessary) so they are easy to find
- [ ] The code review checklist for each PR is completed before merging to `main`
- [ ] Each pull request either passes CI checks, or the failing CI checks are discussed in code review
- [ ] Each pull request is reviewed by at least one classmate using GitHub code review features before merging to `main`
- [ ] All code review discussions are positive and constructive - _review the code, not the person_
- [ ] Your group used helpful branch naming conventions

!! **Note** !! _You will not be assessed on how hard your coding challenges are_ !! !!
