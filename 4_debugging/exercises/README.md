# Debugging: Exercises

In these exercises you are given buggy functions and unit tests generated with different LLMs.

Learning to test, understand and debug code is now more important than ever! LLMs can generate lots of code very quickly, but you still need to clearly tell them what to write (_documentation_), verify the code work correctly (_testing_), and modify the code when it doesn't (_debugging_).

1. [Buggy Tests](./1_buggy_tests/): The functions (should) work, the unit tests are buggy
1. [Buggy Functions](./2_buggy_functions/): The functions are buggy, the unit tests (should) work.
1. [Figure it Out](./3_figure_it_out/): The functions or the tests can be buggy, you're on your own!
