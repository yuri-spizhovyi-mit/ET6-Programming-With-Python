def count_between(numbers: list, lower: int, upper: int) -> int:
    """Counts how many numbers in the list fall between lower and upper bounds.
    
    The bounds are inclusive, meaning a number equal to the lower or upper
    bound is counted. The numbers list can contain integers or floats.
    
    Parameters:
        numbers: list of numbers to check
        lower: int, lower bound (inclusive)
        upper: int, upper bound (inclusive)
        
    Returns -> int: count of numbers between bounds
    
    Raises:
        AssertionError: if numbers is not a list or bounds aren't integers
    
    Examples:
        >>> count_between([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2, 4)
        3
        >>> count_between([1.5, 2.5, 3.5], 2, 3)
