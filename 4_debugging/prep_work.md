# Prep Work

Nothing new here technically!  Debugging is a way of thinking, some good habits, and some helpful strategies.  This workshop will build on the skills, tools and language features from the previous workshops to help you be more comfortable fixing bugs.

The best way to prepare for the _Debugging_ workshop is to read through the [Debugging README](./README.md) and [Philosophy of Debugging](./philosophy_of_debugging.md), then continue practicing what we covered in the _Predictive Stepping_ and _Documenting and Testing_ workshops.
