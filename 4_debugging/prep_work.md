# Lesson Plan

## Workshop Overview _(all together)_

The workshop instructor will introduce the main concepts of this workshop:

- Introduce the workshop's [learning objectives](./README.md#learning-objectives).
- Demonstrate _predictive stepping_ in a debugger.

## Practice Predictive Stepping _(small groups)_

Have one person in your group share their screen, then practice asking and
answering these questions as you study the programs in
[/0_stepping_through](./0_stepping_through):

Before each step:

- Which line will run next?
- What will change in memory? (_variables_ and _callstack_!)

After each step:

- Were your predictions correct?
- If now, why? What did you miss when you made your prediction?

## The Debugging Mindset _(all together)_

- Each group will have 1 minute to share:
  - One thing they couldn't understand
  - One interesting thing they learned
- Introduce the next exercises

## Describe Bugs _(small groups)_

Try to find the bug in each program of
[/1_describing_bugs](./1_describing_bugs/):

## Discussion & Introduce Next Exercise _(all together)_

- Each group will have 1-2 minutes to share:
  - One thing they couldn't figure out
  - One surprising thing they learned
  - One thing they'd like to discuss with the full class
- Discuss how you approach code differently when you expect it has a bug, and
  why it's important to always think this way.
- Introduce the next exercises.

## Fixing Bugs _(small groups)_

Find and fix as many bugs as you can in [/2_fixing_bugs](./2_fixing_bugs)!

## Discussion _(all together)_

- Each group will have 2-3 minutes to share:
  - One thing they couldn't figure out
  - One surprising thing they learned
  - One thing they'd like to discuss with the full class
- Discuss!
