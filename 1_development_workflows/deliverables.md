# Deliverables

Your deliverable is to create a Profile README for your GitHub account using
[the template `username` repository](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/username). This isn't busy work! Creating this README will
turn your GitHub account into a mini CV with a list of your experience,
interests, and anything else you'd like to share.

## Checklist

- [ ] You created your Profile README repository using
      [the template `username` repository](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/username)
- [ ] Your repository’s name matches your GitHub username.
- [ ] All of the CI checks pass under the Actions tab. _Or_ you commented the lines that failed CI checks explaining why you broke the rule to get the README you wanted. (eg. “I used HTML to align the image in the center”)
