# Deliverables

Your deliverable is to create a Profile README for your GitHub account using
[the template `username` repository](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/username). This isn't busy work! Creating this README will
turn your GitHub account into a mini CV with a list of your experience,
interests, and anything else you'd like to share.

## Checklist

- [ ] You created your Profile README repository using
      [the template `username` repository](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/username)
