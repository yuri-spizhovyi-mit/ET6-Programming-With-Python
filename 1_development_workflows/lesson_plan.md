## Learning Objectives

Just Enough Workflow:

- Basic idea of computers:  _applications, folder system, computing_

- Cloning a repository from GitHub.

- Writing and editing Python and Markdown.

- Formatting and linting Markdown.

- Using Git to version and host your code online.

- Passing Continuous Integration checks.

- _For this week: [objectives in the README](./README.md#learning-objectives)_

### Your Device: _File System_

```txt
/emerging_talent       <- folder
  /notes               <- folder
    command_line.md    <- file
    git.md             <- file
    python.txt
  /data_sets
    UK_health_expenses_23.csv
    UK_health_outcomes_23.csv
  /notebooks

### Your Device: _Applications_

- help you connect _data_ and _computing_ to do something useful

- can access and modify your file system

- can use your computer's processing resources
  - _passes data input -> ... computing ... -> uses data output_

- help you understand what's happening inside your device

### Applications: _CLI vs. GUI_

### Applications: _Git_

<img alt="Git" src="./.assets/git.png" height="70%"  width="70%">

???

Git helps you:

- save versions of your project you can return to
- create experiments without risking the main project
- combine experiments with the main project
- tag past versions of the project
- share this history remotely with other computers

## Deliverables: _Profile README_

**Create [a GitHub profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) ...**

**using [this template repository](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/username) ...**

**written in VSCode, [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) or [VSCode.dev](http://vscode.dev/)...**

**passing all [Continuous Integration](https://github.com/resources/articles/devops/ci-cd) checks ([like this](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/username/actions))...**

**... or, explain in a comment why you are ignoring the rule.**

**And, start on [Python Self-Study 1](../2__python_self_study_1/).**
