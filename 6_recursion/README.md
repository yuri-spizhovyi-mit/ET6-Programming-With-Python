# Recursion

A recursive function is one that calls itself to solve a problem. Rather than
tackling a big problem all at once with little steps (like a for loop),
recursion breaks the problem into smaller versions of the same problem, solves
the smallest part, and combines the results. This strategy of breaking down and
building back up is a key strategy in computer science.

## Learning Objectives

- ü•ö **The Callstack**: You can inspect, explain, and predict a program's
  callstack using the debugger.
- ü•ö **Stack Overflow**: You can inspect and explain stack overflow errors.
- ü•ö **Parts of a Recursive Solution**: You can explain how the 5 parts of a
  recursion solution work together:
  - _Base Case_
  - _Turn-Around_
  - _Break-Down_
  - _Recursion_
  - _Build-Up_
- ü•ö **Labeling Recursive Solutions**: You can use comments to identify and
  label the 5 parts of a recursive solution written in Python.
- ü•ö **(semi)Formal Definition**: You can write a (semi)formal recursive
  definition to describe a recursive solution written in Python.
- üê£ **Visualizing Implementation**: You can use the debugger and print
  statements to visualize a recursive solution's implementation.
- üê£ **Visualizing Strategy**: You can visualize a recursive solution's strategy
  using the tool(s) of your choice:
  - The `trace_calls` decorator in this repository.
  - Python Packages:
    [`rcviz`](https://github.com/carlsborg/rcviz?tab=readme-ov-file),
    [recursion-visualizer](https://pypi.org/project/recursion-visualizer/),
    [Recursion-Tree-Visualizer](https://github.com/Bishalsarang/Recursion-Tree-Visualizer?tab=readme-ov-file)

- üê£ **Debugging Recursion**: You can use the 5 parts of recursion to help find
  and fix bugs in a recursive solution.
- üê•**Writing Recursion**: You can plan a recursive solution using the 5 parts
  as a guide, then can implement your strategy as a Python function.
