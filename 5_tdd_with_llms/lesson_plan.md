# Workshop Outline

## Workshop Overview _(all together)_

The workshop instructor will introduce the main concepts of this workshop:

- Introduce the workshop's [learning objectives](./README.md#learning-objectives).
- Discuss some trade-offs to consider when studying and developing with an LLM.
- Talk through the [CoAIthoring Workflow](./coaithoring-workflow.md).
- Demonstrate how to do TDD with an LLM by developing a function that adds two
  numbers
  - We will use [phind](https://phind.com) because you do not need to create an
    account.
- Introduce the group exercises.

## Practice CoAIthoring _(small groups)_

Each small group will choose one of the [/exercises](./exercises/) and develop
tests + a solution using [phind](https://phind.com) for support.

You can start with any exercise you like, and move on to another if you finish.

## Discussion _(all together)_

Back together, you will have an informal discussion with the other groups and
the workshop leader.

1. Each group will have 2-3 minutes to share:
   - One thing they couldn't figure out
   - One surprising thing they learned
   - One thing they'd like to discuss with the full class
2. Discuss!
