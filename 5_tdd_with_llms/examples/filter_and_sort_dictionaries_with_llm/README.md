# Filter and Sort

> This example is from the [Workflow with LLM guide video](../../workflow_with_llm.mp4)

Write a function that filters a list of dicts by key, and alphabetizes the
entries by value. The function should not modify the argument list.

> The files in this example show snapshots the process I followed to develop a
> function with the help of [Phind](https://www.phind.com/) and
> [Code by AI](https://codebyai.dev/).
