# Prep Work

Read through these two documents:

- [Test-Driven Development](./test_driven_development.md)
- [CoAIthoring Workflow](./coaithoring_workflow.md)

Read through the examples:

- `examples/stepped_*`: These folders contains worked examples of developing
  with an LLM. Each of the files is a snapshot of a different step the
  development process. The final product is in one file, not two files like
  yours should be.
- `examples/separated_*`: This folder contains examples of the finished product
  _after_ you have developed a solution with an LLM. You should notice that the
  finished code is no different from what you learned in Documenting and
  Testing, that's on purpose! LLMs may improve your development _process_, but
  they do not change the need for well tested, documented, and understandable
  code.
