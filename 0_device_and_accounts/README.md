# Device and Accounts

Take some time in the days before the
[Development Workflows](../01_development_workflows/) workshop to set up your
GitHub account and device so you're ready to start strong.

We will consider your device when assessing your Foundations Track deliverables,
you will not be penalized if you do not have a desktop/laptop. The best option
for programming if you don't have a laptop/desktop is to use GitHub Codespaces or [VSCode.dev](https://vscode.dev):

- **A mobile device or tablet**: You can complete the Fundamentals Track
  deliverables using your GitHub account and GitHub Codespaces or VSCode.dev. It will be less
  convenient to type without a full keyboard, but it is possible.
- **A shared laptop/desktop where you cannot install software**: You can
  download Python scripts to study without saving changes, and you can use
  GitHub Codespaces or VSCode.dev to finalize and push your deliverables.
- **A laptop/desktop where you can install software but don't have a private
  account**: You can install and configure VSCode and clone class materials to
  the device, but you won't want to connect the computer to GitHub with SSH -
  this would give all users access to your account.
- **A laptop/desktop where you can install software and have a private
  account**: You can install and download all class resources for offline study
  and connect your computer to GitHub. You're set! Everything you prepares for
  Emerging Talent will serve you in professional work as well.

If you do not have stable internet and are studying from a mobile device or
tablet reach out to the Emerging Talent team, we can help you come up with a
study strategy.

## Learning Objectives

<details>
<summary>Priorities: ü•ö, üê£, üê•, üêî (click to learn more)</summary>
<br>

There is a lot to learn in this repository. If you can't master all the material
at once, that's expected! Anything you don't master now will always be waiting
for you to review when you need it. These 4 emoji's will help you prioritize
your study time and to measure your progress:

- ü•ö: Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll
  need for this module and the next. You do not need to finish all of them but
  should feel comfortable that you could with enough time.
- üê£: You have started all of these exercises and feel you could complete them
  all if you just had more time. It may not be easy for you but with effort you
  can make it through.
- üê•: You have studied the examples and started some exercises if you had time.
  You should have a big-picture understanding of these concepts/skills, but may
  not be confident completing the exercises.
- üêî: These concepts or skills are not necessary but are related to this module.
  If you are finished with ü•ö, üê£ and üê• you can use the üêî exercises to push
  yourself without getting distracted from the module's main objectives.

  - [ ] ü•ö **File System Management**: You can create and organize a new folder
        in your personal computer for the materials you will study at Emerging
        Talent.
- **Visual Studio Code**:
  - [ ] ü•ö You can open a folder in a new window
  - [ ] ü•ö You can add a new file to your folder

## Deliverables

### Background Study

Take a first look through the [Suggested Study](../suggested_study/) resources
focusing on these topics.  Suggested Study is just a suggestion!  You can study these topics using any resources in any language you prefer:

- [ ] **README**: Learning in Public, Being a Developer, Markdown and READMEs
- [ ] **Tech Foundations**: The Internet
- [ ] **CLI**: _especially the games_
- [ ] **Git and GitHub**: Git (_especially the games_)

### Create Your GitHub Account

- [ ] Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already (_no matter what
